# Clone-Festival-Website

This is a React-clone project of an old version of student festival official website [Lesamáj](https://lesamaj.cz/). Built version differs from the current version of the [official page](https://lesamaj.cz/). 

## Deploy

The project should now be running and accessible at: https://react-clone-festival-project.vercel.app/

## Idea of the project

The design, theme, website architecture was fully developed by [Lesamáj Team](https://lesamaj.cz/kontakty/). The main idea of the project is rebuilding the official page from scratch in React environment and futher project migrating from the original build.

## Built with

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.

## Features

Almost all features of this project are similar to features of [the official page](https://lesamaj.cz/). 

The main distinctive feature is perfomance improvement and new pages navigation. All five sections with different content are now managed by React state. Therefore, there is ***no backend part*** in this project, unlike [the original website](https://lesamaj.cz/) that has one.

In addition, all animation was rebuilt in pure CSS.
